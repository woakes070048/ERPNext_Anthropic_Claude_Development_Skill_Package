# Frappe Workflow Implementation

Step-by-step guide for implementing document workflows in Frappe. Covers design, setup, testing, and common approval chain patterns.

## Quick Reference: Implementation Checklist

```
1. □ Design states and transitions on paper/diagram first
2. □ Create Workflow State records (master list)
3. □ Create Workflow Action Master records (Approve, Reject, etc.)
4. □ Create the Workflow DocType record
5. □ Add states with correct doc_status values
6. □ Add transitions with roles, actions, and conditions
7. □ Set allow_edit roles per state
8. □ Configure email notifications (optional)
9. □ Test every transition path with test users
10. □ Verify self-approval blocking works as expected
```

## Step 1: Design Your Workflow

Before touching the UI, map out your workflow on paper.

### Identify States

**ALWAYS** start by listing every distinct document stage:

```
Example — Purchase Order Approval:
  Draft → Pending Review → Pending Approval → Approved → Submitted → Cancelled
```

### Map DocStatus to States

For submittable DocTypes, ALWAYS assign `doc_status` correctly:

| Stage | doc_status | Meaning |
|-------|:-:|---------|
| All "in-progress" states | 0 | Document is Draft, editable |
| Final approved/active state | 1 | Document is Submitted, locked |
| Cancelled state | 2 | Document is Cancelled |

**NEVER** assign `doc_status = 1` to intermediate approval states. A submitted document cannot return to draft. Once submitted, the only forward path is another submitted state or cancellation.

### Map Transitions

For each state, define: What actions are possible? Who can perform them? Any conditions?

```
Draft         →[Submit for Review / Creator]→     Pending Review
Pending Review →[Approve / Reviewer]→              Pending Approval
Pending Review →[Reject / Reviewer]→               Draft
Pending Approval →[Approve / Manager]→             Approved
Pending Approval →[Reject / Manager]→              Draft
Approved      →[Submit / Manager]→                 Submitted (doc_status=1)
Submitted     →[Cancel / Manager]→                 Cancelled (doc_status=2)
```

## Step 2: Create Prerequisite Records

### 2a. Create Workflow States

Navigate to **Workflow State** list or create via API:

```python
# Create states with appropriate styles
states = [
    {"workflow_state_name": "Draft", "style": ""},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Pending Review", "style": "Primary"},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Pending Approval", "style": "Warning"},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Approved", "style": "Success"},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Submitted", "style": "Info"},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Rejected", "style": "Danger"},
    {"workflow_state_name": "Cancelled", "style": "Inverse"},
]
for s in states:
    if not frappe.db.exists("Workflow State", s["workflow_state_name"]):
        frappe.get_doc({"doctype": "Workflow State", **s}).insert()
```

Available styles: `Primary`, `Success`, `Warning`, `Danger`, `Info`, `Inverse` (or empty for default).

### 2b. Create Workflow Action Masters

```python
actions = ["Submit for Review", "Approve", "Reject", "Send Back", "Cancel"]
for action in actions:
    if not frappe.db.exists("Workflow Action Master", action):
        frappe.get_doc({
            "doctype": "Workflow Action Master",
            "workflow_action_name": action
        }).insert()
```

## Step 3: Create the Workflow

### Via UI

Navigate to **Setup > Workflow > New Workflow**:

1. Set **Workflow Name** (e.g., "Purchase Order Approval")
2. Set **Document Type** (e.g., "Purchase Order")
3. Check **Is Active**
4. Add states in the **States** table
5. Add transitions in the **Transitions** table

### Via Python

```python
workflow = frappe.get_doc({
    "doctype": "Workflow",
    "workflow_name": "Purchase Order Approval",
    "document_type": "Purchase Order",
    "is_active": 1,
    "send_email_alert": 1,
    "states": [
        {"state": "Draft", "doc_status": "0", "allow_edit": "Purchase User"},
        {"state": "Pending Approval", "doc_status": "0", "allow_edit": "Purchase Manager"},
        {"state": "Approved", "doc_status": "1", "allow_edit": "Purchase Manager"},
        {"state": "Rejected", "doc_status": "0", "allow_edit": "Purchase User"},
        {"state": "Cancelled", "doc_status": "2"},
    ],
    "transitions": [
        {
            "state": "Draft",
            "action": "Submit for Review",
            "next_state": "Pending Approval",
            "allowed": "Purchase User",
            "allow_self_approval": 1,
        },
        {
            "state": "Pending Approval",
            "action": "Approve",
            "next_state": "Approved",
            "allowed": "Purchase Manager",
            "allow_self_approval": 0,
        },
        {
            "state": "Pending Approval",
            "action": "Reject",
            "next_state": "Rejected",
            "allowed": "Purchase Manager",
        },
        {
            "state": "Rejected",
            "action": "Submit for Review",
            "next_state": "Pending Approval",
            "allowed": "Purchase User",
        },
        {
            "state": "Approved",
            "action": "Cancel",
            "next_state": "Cancelled",
            "allowed": "Purchase Manager",
        },
    ],
})
workflow.insert()
```

## Step 4: Configure Advanced Features

### Conditional Transitions

Add Python conditions to show transitions only when criteria are met:

```python
# Only allow approval for orders above 50000 by Senior Manager
{
    "state": "Pending Approval",
    "action": "Approve",
    "next_state": "Approved",
    "allowed": "Senior Manager",
    "condition": "doc.grand_total > 50000",
}

# Standard approval for orders up to 50000
{
    "state": "Pending Approval",
    "action": "Approve",
    "next_state": "Approved",
    "allowed": "Purchase Manager",
    "condition": "doc.grand_total <= 50000",
}
```

**ALWAYS** use `doc.fieldname` syntax in conditions (the document is exposed as a dict).

Available in conditions: `frappe.db.get_value()`, `frappe.db.get_list()`, `frappe.session.user`, `frappe.utils.now_datetime()`, `frappe.utils.add_to_date()`, `frappe.utils.get_datetime()`.

### Self-Approval Blocking

Set `allow_self_approval = 0` on approval transitions. This means:
- The document **owner** (creator) CANNOT perform this action
- Administrator is ALWAYS exempt from this restriction
- Other users with the required role CAN perform the action

### Email Notifications

1. Set `send_email_alert = 1` on the Workflow
2. On each state row, set `send_email = 1` (default)
3. Optionally link an `Email Template` via `next_action_email_template`
4. Add a custom `message` on the state row for inline notification text

### Update Fields on State Change

Use `update_field` and `update_value` on state rows to automatically set document fields:

```python
# Set approval_status when entering "Approved" state
{"state": "Approved", "doc_status": "1",
 "update_field": "approval_status", "update_value": "Approved"}

# Use expression to set approval date dynamically
{"state": "Approved", "doc_status": "1",
 "update_field": "custom_approved_on", "update_value": "frappe.utils.now()",
 "evaluate_as_expression": 1}
```

## Step 5: Test Your Workflow

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Create a test document** — verify it starts in the first state (Draft)
2. **Check available actions** — only roles with transitions from Draft should see buttons
3. **Perform each transition** — verify state changes correctly
4. **Test rejection paths** — verify documents return to correct state
5. **Test self-approval** — log in as document owner, verify blocked transitions
6. **Test conditions** — create documents that meet/fail conditions, verify button visibility
7. **Test email notifications** — verify emails sent on state changes
8. **Test with non-submittable DocType** — verify all doc_status = 0

### Programmatic Testing

```python
# Get available transitions for a document
from frappe.model.workflow import get_transitions, apply_workflow

doc = frappe.get_doc("Purchase Order", "PO-00001")
transitions = get_transitions(doc)
# Returns list of dicts with action, next_state, allowed, etc.

# Apply a workflow action
updated_doc = apply_workflow(doc, "Approve")
# Returns the updated document after state change
```

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Approval Chain

```
Draft → Level 1 Review → Level 2 Review → Approved → Submitted
```

Each level has its own role. Document moves linearly through approvals.

### Pattern 2: Conditional Routing by Amount

```
Draft → Pending Approval
  ├─[amount <= 10000 / Team Lead]─→ Approved
  ├─[amount <= 50000 / Manager]──→ Approved
  └─[amount > 50000 / Director]──→ Approved
```

Use `condition` on each transition to route based on document values.

### Pattern 3: Review with Rejection Loop

```
Draft ←──[Reject]── Pending Review ──[Approve]──→ Approved
  └──[Submit for Review]──→ Pending Review
```

Rejected documents return to Draft for revision. Creator resubmits. This is the most common approval pattern.

### Pattern 4: Leave Approval

```
Applied (doc_status=0, allow_edit=Employee)
  └─[Approve / Leave Approver]─→ Approved (doc_status=1)
  └─[Reject / Leave Approver]─→ Rejected (doc_status=0)
Approved
  └─[Cancel / HR Manager]─→ Cancelled (doc_status=2)
```

### Pattern 5: Document Review (Non-Submittable)

For non-submittable DocTypes, ALL states MUST have `doc_status = 0`:

```
Draft → Under Review → Reviewed → Published
(all doc_status = 0)
```

## Migrating from Manual DocStatus to Workflow

If your DocType currently uses manual Submit/Cancel buttons and you want to add a workflow:

1. **Map existing documents** — The workflow engine auto-maps existing documents to states based on their `docstatus` when the workflow is created
2. **Define a state for each docstatus** — ALWAYS have at least one state per docstatus value your documents currently use
3. **Test with existing data** — Verify that existing submitted documents show the correct workflow state
4. **Update list views** — If using `override_status`, the workflow state replaces the Status column

**NEVER** activate a workflow without a state for docstatus=0. New documents would have no valid initial state.

## Decision Tree

```
Starting a new workflow implementation?
│
├── What type of DocType?
│   ├── Submittable → can use doc_status 0, 1, 2
│   └── Non-submittable → ALL states must be doc_status = 0
│
├── How many approval levels?
│   ├── Single → Two-state: Draft → Approved
│   ├── Sequential → Chain: Draft → L1 → L2 → Approved
│   └── Conditional → Route by field values using conditions
│
├── Need self-approval blocking?
│   └── Set allow_self_approval = 0 on approval transitions
│
├── Need rejection/revision loop?
│   └── Add Reject transition back to Draft or previous state
│
├── Need email notifications?
│   ├── Enable send_email_alert on Workflow
│   └── Link Email Template on each state
│
└── Need automated field updates?
    └── Use update_field + update_value on target state
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| No action buttons visible | User lacks required role | Add role to user OR add transition for user's role |
| "Self approval is not allowed" | User is doc owner + `allow_self_approval=0` | Have different user approve, or set flag to 1 |
| "Workflow State not set" | Document created before workflow activation | Run `update_default_workflow_status` or manually set state |
| Document stuck in state | No outgoing transition defined for current state + user role | Add missing transition |
| "Cannot cancel before submitting" | Transition goes from doc_status=0 to doc_status=2 | Add intermediate submitted state |
| Actions show for wrong users | Role assignment too broad | Use more specific roles or add conditions |
