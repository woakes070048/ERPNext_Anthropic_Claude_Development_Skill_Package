## Quick Reference: Frappe Cloud Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Site** | A single Frappe instance with its own database, domain, and apps |
| **Bench** | A shared runtime environment hosting one or more sites with the same app versions |
| **Server** | The underlying infrastructure (VM) running one or more benches |
| **Private Bench** | A dedicated bench for a single customer with full control |
| **Shared Bench** | A Frappe-managed bench shared across multiple sites |
| **Press** | The open-source platform (AGPL-3.0) that powers Frappe Cloud |
| **Agent** | Flask application on each server enabling Press-to-site communication |

## Decision Tree: Frappe Cloud vs Self-Hosted

```
Choosing hosting strategy:
├── Small team, want zero ops overhead?
│   └── Frappe Cloud (Shared Bench) — fastest time to production
├── Need custom server configuration?
│   ├── Budget for managed infra? → Frappe Cloud (Private Bench)
│   └── Want full control? → Self-hosted with bench
├── Need to host Frappe for multiple clients?
│   ├── Want managed platform? → Frappe Cloud
│   └── Want own platform? → Self-hosted Press

- **Install/remove apps** — Add or remove Frappe apps from sites
- **Backups** — Manual and scheduled backups, restore from backup
- **Domain management** — Add custom domains with automatic SSL
- **Site config** — Edit `site_config.json` via the dashboard
- **Monitoring** — View CPU, memory, disk usage, and request logs
- **Site actions** — Migrate, update, suspend, archive, or transfer sites

### Bench Management

- **Create benches** — Set up shared or private benches
- **App management** — Select apps and their versions/branches
- **Update scheduling** — Control when benches receive updates
- **Environment variables** — Set custom environment variables
- **SSH access** — Connect to bench via SSH for debugging
- **Log browser** — View application and error logs
- **Database access** — Query the database via the dashboard

## Deploying Apps on Frappe Cloud

### Adding a Custom App

1. Navigate to **Apps** in the Frappe Cloud dashboard
2. Click **Add App** and provide the GitHub repository URL
3. Select the branch to deploy
4. Configure build settings if needed
5. The app becomes available for installation on sites within compatible benches

### App Marketplace

Frappe Cloud includes a marketplace where developers can:

- List apps with descriptions and pricing
- Set compatibility requirements (Frappe version, dependencies)
- Configure pricing models (free, one-time, subscription)
- Manage payouts for commercial apps
- Track installations and usage analytics

### Deployment Workflow

```
Developer pushes code → Frappe Cloud detects update →
  Bench rebuild triggered → Assets compiled →
    Sites migrated → New version live
```

**For Private Benches**: Updates are controlled by the bench owner — NEVER auto-deployed without approval.

**For Shared Benches**: Frappe manages the update schedule.

---

## Site Provisioning Workflow

### Creating a New Site

1. **Select bench** — Choose shared or private bench
2. **Choose plan** — Select resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)
3. **Configure apps** — Select which apps to install
4. **Set domain** — Use `*.frappe.cloud` subdomain or custom domain
5. **Create** — Frappe Cloud provisions the site (typically under 5 minutes)

### Custom Domain Setup

1. Navigate to site **Domains** in the dashboard
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `erp.example.com`)
3. Configure DNS: Add a **CNAME** record pointing to the Frappe Cloud proxy
4. Frappe Cloud verifies DNS and provisions SSL certificate automatically
5. **ALWAYS** wait for DNS propagation before expecting SSL to work (up to 48 hours)

### Critical Rules

- **ALWAYS** use CNAME records for custom domains (not A records)
- **NEVER** transfer DNS to Frappe Cloud — only add CNAME records
- **ALWAYS** verify SSL is active before switching production traffic
- Custom domain SSL uses Let's Encrypt — auto-renews before expiry

## Press: Self-Hosted Frappe Cloud

### What Is Press?

Press is the open-source platform (AGPL-3.0) that powers Frappe Cloud. Organizations can self-host Press to create their own managed hosting platform for Frappe applications.

**GitHub**: `https://github.com/frappe/press`

### Architecture

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Press | Frappe Framework | Platform management, billing, dashboard |
| Agent | Flask | Server-to-site communication |
| Docker | Container runtime | App packaging and deployment |
| Ansible | Automation | Server provisioning and configuration |
| Frappe UI | Vue.js | Dashboard frontend |

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-server management** — Provision and manage multiple servers
- **Site lifecycle** — Create, update, migrate, backup, restore, archive sites
- **Bench management** — Deploy benches with specific app versions
- **Billing system** — Subscriptions, invoicing, wallet credits, ERP integration
- **Marketplace** — App listing, pricing, payouts
- **Role-based access** — Granular permissions per team and resource
- **Monitoring** — Real-time metrics and alerting

### When to Self-Host Press

- You need to host Frappe for multiple clients/tenants
- You want a managed platform but on your own infrastructure
- You need full data sovereignty and regulatory compliance
- You want to offer Frappe hosting as a service

### When NOT to Self-Host Press

- **NEVER** self-host Press for a single site — use bench directly
- **NEVER** self-host Press without dedicated DevOps capacity
- **NEVER** underestimate the operational overhead — Press itself requires maintenance

### Self-Hosting Requirements

- Dedicated servers (bare metal or VMs) with Ubuntu
- DNS management for wildcard domains
- Object storage for backups (S3-compatible)
- SMTP service for transactional email
- Familiarity with Ansible, Docker, and Frappe Framework

## Frappe Cloud Limitations

### What You CANNOT Do on Frappe Cloud

- Install system-level packages (no root access on shared benches)
- Modify Nginx/Supervisor configuration directly
- Access raw database files (only SQL access via dashboard)
- Run long-running background processes outside Frappe's job queue
- Use non-standard ports or protocols

### Shared Bench Limitations

- No SSH access
- No custom environment variables (use site_config.json instead)
- Shared resources with other sites — performance may vary
- Update schedule controlled by Frappe (not the site owner)

### Private Bench Advantages Over Shared

- SSH access for debugging
- Custom environment variables
- Controlled update schedule
- Dedicated resources
- Custom app versions and branches

---

## Frappe Cloud Best Practices

### Site Configuration

- **ALWAYS** set `maintenance_mode` before large data imports
- **ALWAYS** use the dashboard for site config changes (not direct file edits)
- **NEVER** disable scheduler on Frappe Cloud — use `pause_scheduler` instead
- **ALWAYS** test app updates on a staging site before production

### Backup Strategy

- Frappe Cloud creates automatic daily backups
- **ALWAYS** create a manual backup before major changes
- **ALWAYS** download and store backups off-platform periodically
- **NEVER** rely solely on Frappe Cloud backups — maintain your own copies

### Performance

- Monitor site usage via the dashboard — upgrade plan before hitting limits
- Use background jobs for heavy operations (not synchronous API calls)
- Enable Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Review slow query logs via the database analyzer tool
