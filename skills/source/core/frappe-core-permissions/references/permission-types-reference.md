## Permission Options

### if_owner

Restricts permission to documents created by the user.

```json
{
  "role": "Sales User",
  "permlevel": 0,
  "read": 1,
  "write": 1,
  "if_owner": 1
}
```

**Effect**: Sales User can only read/write documents they created (owner field matches).

### set_user_permissions

Allows the user to create User Permission records for other users on this DocType.

```json
{
  "role": "Sales Manager",
  "permlevel": 0,
  "set_user_permissions": 1
}
```

## Permission Levels (Perm Levels)

### Concept

Group fields into levels (0-9) for separate permission control per role.

### Configuration

```json
// Field definition
{"fieldname": "salary", "fieldtype": "Currency", "permlevel": 1}

// Role permission
{"role": "HR Manager", "permlevel": 1, "read": 1, "write": 1}
```

### Rules

1. Level 0 MUST be granted before higher levels — ALWAYS
2. Levels do NOT imply hierarchy (level 2 is NOT "higher" than level 1)
3. Levels group fields; roles grant access to groups
4. A Section Break with permlevel affects all fields in that section

### Example

```
Field: employee_name    permlevel: 0  → All roles with level 0 read
Field: phone           permlevel: 0  → All roles with level 0 read
Field: salary          permlevel: 1  → Only roles with level 1 read
Field: bank_account    permlevel: 1  → Only roles with level 1 read
Field: performance     permlevel: 2  → Only roles with level 2 read
```

## Automatic Roles

| Role | Assigned To | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `Guest` | All users (including anonymous) | Public website pages |
| `All` | All registered users (including website users) | Basic authenticated access |
| `Administrator` | Only the Administrator user | Full system control |
| `Desk User` | System Users only [v15+] | Desk/backend access |

These roles are hidden in the Role list and CANNOT be manually assigned or removed.

## Custom Permission Types [v16+]

### Creating Custom Permission

1. Enable Developer Mode
2. Create a Permission Type record (e.g., `approve`)
3. Export as fixture for deployment
4. Use in Role Permission Manager

### Checking

```python
if frappe.has_permission("Sales Order", "approve", doc):
    approve_document(doc)
```

---

## Permission Precedence Order

1. **Administrator** — ALWAYS has all permissions (cannot be restricted)
2. **Role Permissions** — Based on assigned roles
3. **User Permissions** — Restricts to specific document values
4. **has_permission hook** — Can only deny (any `False` = denied)
5. **Sharing** — Grants access to individual shared documents
6. **if_owner** — Further restricts to owned documents
