# Workflow Engine

The Frappe Workflow engine is a state machine that controls document lifecycle through configurable states, transitions, and role-based permissions. It governs when and how documents change status, who can perform actions, and what side effects occur on each transition.

## Quick Reference

```

### Key Fields on Workflow DocType

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `workflow_name` | Data | Unique identifier |
| `document_type` | Link → DocType | Target DocType |
| `is_active` | Check | Only ONE workflow per DocType can be active |
| `workflow_state_field` | Data | Default: `workflow_state` |
| `override_status` | Check | Prevent workflow from overriding list view status |
| `send_email_alert` | Check | Email notifications with next possible actions |

## How the Engine Works

### 1. Activation and Field Creation

When a Workflow is saved with `is_active = 1`:
- All other workflows for the same DocType are deactivated automatically
- A hidden Custom Field (`workflow_state_field`, default `workflow_state`) is created on the target DocType if it does not exist
- The field is type `Link` to `Workflow State`, with `hidden=1`, `allow_on_submit=1`, `no_copy=1`
- Existing documents with empty workflow state get their state set based on their current `docstatus`

### 2. State Resolution

Every document under a workflow has a `workflow_state` field. The engine resolves available transitions by:

1. Reading current `workflow_state` from the document
2. Filtering `workflow.transitions` where `transition.state == current_state`
3. Filtering by user roles: `transition.allowed in frappe.get_roles()`
4. Evaluating `transition.condition` via `frappe.safe_eval()` (if set)
5. Returning matching transitions as available actions

### 3. Applying a Transition

When `apply_workflow(doc, action)` is called:

1. Load document from DB (fresh read)
2. Get available transitions for current user
3. Find transition matching the requested `action`
4. Check self-approval: blocked if `allow_self_approval=0` AND user is document owner
5. Set `workflow_state_field` to `transition.next_state`
6. If `update_field` is set on the target state, update that field
7. Execute transition tasks (sync first, then async via `frappe.enqueue`)
8. Handle docstatus change based on source/target state `doc_status` values
9. Save/Submit/Cancel document accordingly
10. Add workflow comment

## Workflow and DocStatus Interaction

**CRITICAL**: The workflow engine controls docstatus transitions. You NEVER call `doc.submit()` or `doc.cancel()` directly on a workflow-controlled document. The workflow does it.

### DocStatus Transition Rules

| Source doc_status | Target doc_status | Engine Action | Valid? |
|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|
| 0 (Draft) | 0 (Draft) | `doc.save()` | YES |
| 0 (Draft) | 1 (Submitted) | `doc.submit()` | YES |
| 1 (Submitted) | 1 (Submitted) | `doc.save()` | YES |
| 1 (Submitted) | 2 (Cancelled) | `doc.cancel()` | YES |
| 2 (Cancelled) | ANY | BLOCKED | NO |
| 1 (Submitted) | 0 (Draft) | BLOCKED | NO |
| 0 (Draft) | 2 (Cancelled) | BLOCKED | NO |

**ALWAYS** define your states so that docstatus only moves forward: 0→0, 0→1, 1→1, 1→2.
**NEVER** create a transition from a cancelled state or from submitted back to draft.

### Non-Submittable DocTypes

If the target DocType is NOT submittable, ALL states MUST have `doc_status = 0`. The engine validates this and throws an error if any state has `doc_status = 1` or `2` on a non-submittable DocType.

## Workflow States

Workflow State is a separate DocType used as a master list. Each state has:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `state` | Display name of the state |
| `style` | CSS class for badge display (Primary, Success, Warning, Danger, Info, Inverse) |
| `icon` | Font Awesome icon class |

### State Row Fields (Workflow Document State)

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `state` | Link to Workflow State |
| `doc_status` | Select: 0, 1, or 2 |
| `allow_edit` | Link to Role — ONLY this role can edit the document in this state |
| `update_field` | Field to update when document enters this state |
| `update_value` | Value to set (string or Python expression if `evaluate_as_expression=1`) |
| `is_optional_state` | Check — optional states are skipped in `get_next_possible_transitions` |
| `send_email` | Check (default 1) — send email notification on entering this state |
| `next_action_email_template` | Link to Email Template |
| `message` | Text message for the email notification |

## Workflow Transitions

Each transition row defines one possible action:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `state` | Source state (MUST exist in states table) |
| `action` | Link to Workflow Action Master (e.g., "Approve", "Reject", "Review") |
| `next_state` | Target state (MUST exist in states table) |
| `allowed` | Link to Role — ONLY users with this role see this action |
| `allow_self_approval` | Check (default 1) — if 0, document owner cannot perform this action |
| `condition` | Python expression evaluated with `frappe.safe_eval()` |
| `transition_tasks` | Link to Workflow Transition Tasks (v15+) |

### Condition Expressions

Conditions are Python expressions evaluated in a sandboxed environment. Available globals:

```python
# Available in condition expressions:
frappe.db.get_value(doctype, name, fieldname)
frappe.db.get_list(doctype, filters, fields)
frappe.session.user
frappe.session.roles  # NOT available — use frappe.get_roles() outside conditions
frappe.utils.now_datetime()
frappe.utils.add_to_date(date, **kwargs)
frappe.utils.get_datetime(datetime_str)
frappe.utils.now()
doc.fieldname  # Access any field on the document (as dict)
```

Example conditions:
```python
doc.grand_total > 50000
doc.department == "HR"
doc.grand_total > 50000 and doc.department != "Finance"
```

## Workflow Actions

### Workflow Action Master

Simple DocType with just a `workflow_action_name` field. Common actions: Approve, Reject, Review, Send Back, Cancel. Create these first before defining transitions.

### Workflow Action DocType

Tracks pending actions for users. Created automatically when a document enters a state with outgoing transitions.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `status` | Open or Completed |
| `reference_doctype` | The DocType of the document |
| `reference_name` | The document name |
| `workflow_state` | Current workflow state |
| `user` | Assigned user |
| `permitted_roles` | Table MultiSelect of roles that can act |
| `completed_by` | User who completed the action |
| `completed_by_role` | Role used to complete |

Workflow Actions appear in the user's "Workflow Action" list and can be acted on via email links.

## Self-Approval Control

```python
def has_approval_access(user, doc, transition):
    return (user == "Administrator"
            or transition.get("allow_self_approval")
            or user != doc.get("owner"))
```

- **Administrator** ALWAYS has approval access regardless of settings
- If `allow_self_approval = 1` (default): document owner CAN approve
- If `allow_self_approval = 0`: document owner CANNOT approve their own document

## Decision Tree

```
Need workflow on a DocType?
├── Is DocType submittable?
│   ├── YES → States can use doc_status 0, 1, 2
│   └── NO  → ALL states MUST have doc_status = 0
├── Define states → Create Workflow State records first
├── Define transitions → Need Workflow Action Master records first
├── Who can edit in each state? → Set allow_edit per state
├── Need conditional transitions?
│   └── Use Python expressions with doc.field access
├── Need to block self-approval?
│   └── Set allow_self_approval = 0 on specific transitions
└── Need email notifications?
    └── Set send_email_alert on Workflow + email templates on states
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `WorkflowStateError` | Document has no workflow_state set | Ensure workflow sets initial state on creation |
| `WorkflowTransitionError` | Action not valid for current state/role | Verify transitions table covers all needed paths |
| `WorkflowPermissionError` | User lacks role for transition, or self-approval blocked | Check `allowed` role and `allow_self_approval` |
| "Illegal Document Status" | Invalid docstatus transition (e.g., 0→2) | Fix state `doc_status` values |
| "Cannot cancel before submitting" | Transition from draft (0) to cancelled (2) | Add intermediate submitted (1) state |
