# Scheduler Event Types — Detailed Reference

## Standard Events

These run on the **default** queue with a 300-second timeout.

| Event | Trigger | Typical Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `all` | Every scheduler tick | Frequent polling, status checks |
| `hourly` | Once per hour | Data sync, light cleanup |
| `daily` | Once per day | Reports, daily summaries |
| `weekly` | Once per week | Archival, weekly digests |
| `monthly` | Once per month | Billing, monthly reports |

### Tick Interval

| Version | Interval | Config Key |
|---------|----------|------------|
| v14 | ~240 seconds (4 min) | `scheduler_interval` |
| v15+ | ~60 seconds | `scheduler_tick_interval` |

The `all` event fires on every tick. Other events are tracked by last execution time.

---

## Long Queue Events

These run on the **long** queue with a 1500-second (25 min) timeout.

| Event | Trigger | Typical Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `hourly_long` | Once per hour | Heavy sync, large API calls |
| `daily_long` | Once per day | Large exports, full reindex |
| `weekly_long` | Once per week | Data warehousing, archival |
| `monthly_long` | Once per month | Annual reports, full audits |

ALWAYS use `_long` variants when the task takes more than 5 minutes.

---

## Cron Events

Custom schedules using croniter-compatible strings.

```python
scheduler_events = {
    "cron": {
        "*/5 * * * *": ["myapp.tasks.every_5_minutes"],
        "0 9 * * 1-5": ["myapp.tasks.weekday_9am"],
        "0 8 * * 1": ["myapp.tasks.monday_morning"],
        "0 0 1 * *": ["myapp.tasks.first_of_month"],
        "15 18 * * *": ["myapp.tasks.evening_summary"],
        "0 9-17 * * 1-5": ["myapp.tasks.business_hours"],
    }
}
```

### Cron Syntax Reference

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6, Sunday=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `*` | Any value | `* * * * *` = every minute |
| `,` | Value list | `1,15 * * * *` = minute 1 and 15 |
| `-` | Range | `0 9-17 * * *` = hours 9 through 17 |
| `/` | Step/interval | `*/10 * * * *` = every 10 minutes |

## Runtime-Configurable Events

For events that need to be adjusted without code deployment, use `Scheduled Job Type` DocType:

```python
# Create via code (or via desk UI)
job = frappe.new_doc("Scheduled Job Type")
job.method = "myapp.tasks.configurable_task"
job.frequency = "Cron"
job.cron_format = "0/5 * * * *"
job.save()
```

This is useful when administrators need to adjust scheduling without developer intervention.

---

## Multiple Methods Per Event

```python
scheduler_events = {
    "daily": [
        "myapp.tasks.cleanup_logs",
        "myapp.tasks.send_daily_report",
        "myapp.tasks.sync_external_data",
    ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Execution order of multiple methods within the same event is NOT guaranteed. If order matters, use a single function that calls them sequentially.

---

## Event Function Requirements

Every scheduler event function:
- Takes NO arguments
- Runs as **Administrator** user
- Has access to `frappe.db`, `frappe.get_all()`, etc.
- Should handle its own errors (unhandled exceptions are logged to Error Log)

```python
def my_scheduler_task():
    """CORRECT — no parameters."""
    records = frappe.get_all("MyDocType")
    for record in records:
        process(record)
```

---

## Scheduled Job Log

Every execution of a scheduler event creates a `Scheduled Job Log` record:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Scheduled Job Type | Name of the job |
| Status | Complete / Failed |
| Method | Executed Python method |
| Start | Start timestamp |
| End | End timestamp |
| Error | Error message (on failure) |
