# Way of Work: Developing AI Skill Packages with Claude

> A methodology for creating comprehensive, deterministic skill and agent packages for open source projects using Claude AI

## Overview

This document describes a proven methodology for developing AI skill packages that enable Claude instances to generate flawless code for specific frameworks or technologies. This approach was developed and validated during the creation of the ERPNext/Frappe Skills Package project.

The methodology emphasizes:
- **Deep research before development**
- **Deterministic, verifiable content**
- **One-shot execution without iterations**
- **English-only skills** (Claude reads English, responds in any language)
- **Version control integration**

## Phase 1: Deep Research

### Purpose
Gain comprehensive understanding of the target technology/framework before any planning begins.

### Activities
- Explore official documentation extensively
- Identify all major mechanisms/APIs/patterns
- Discover edge cases and version differences
- Find common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Gather real-world examples

### Output
Raw knowledge and insights (may be informal notes or conversation)

### Key Principle
> "You cannot create deterministic skills for something you don't deeply understand."

### Example from ERPNext Project
We started by exploring all scripting mechanisms in ERPNext/Frappe:
- Client Scripts (JavaScript)
- Server Scripts (Python sandbox)
- Document Controllers
- hooks.py configuration
- Jinja templates
- Scheduler/Background jobs
- Whitelisted API methods

This revealed critical insights like the Server Script sandbox blocking all imports - a fundamental limitation that would affect all code generation.

---

## Phase 2: Preliminary Research Document

### Purpose
Consolidate deep research into a structured reference document that serves as the foundation for all subsequent work.

### Activities
- Organize findings into logical sections
- Document syntax patterns with examples
- Create decision matrices (when to use what)
- Note version differences explicitly
- List sources and verification status

### Output
`vooronderzoek.md` or `preliminary-research.md` - A comprehensive reference document

### Structure Template
```markdown
# [Technology] Preliminary Research

## 1. Overview
Brief description of the technology landscape

## 2. Mechanism A
### Syntax
### Use Cases
### Version Differences
### Anti-patterns

## 3. Mechanism B
[repeat structure]

## N. Decision Matrix
When to use which mechanism

## Sources
- Official documentation links
- GitHub source code references
- Community resources (dated 2023+)
```

### Key Principle
> "The preliminary research document becomes the single source of truth for all skill development."

---

## Phase 3: Requirements Definition

### Purpose
Define what the skill package must achieve and establish quality criteria.

### Activities
- Identify target users (other Claude instances, developers)
- Define skill categories needed
- Establish constraints (line limits, structure requirements)
- Set quality guarantees
- Determine language requirements (bilingual, etc.)

### Output
Clear requirements document or section in masterplan

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What problems should the skills solve?
2. What should a Claude instance be able to do after loading these skills?
3. What quality guarantees do we provide?
4. What are the structural constraints (Anthropic conventions)?
5. What languages/versions must be supported?

### Example Requirements (ERPNext Project)
- Skills must be deterministic (no assumptions)
- SKILL.md files must stay under 500 lines
- All skills in English only (Claude reads English, responds in any language)
- Version-explicit for ERPNext v14, v15, and v16
- Follow official Anthropic skill-creator conventions
- One-shot execution (no proof-of-concepts)

---

## Phase 4: Detailed Masterplan

### Purpose
Create a comprehensive, phased execution plan with prompts for each step.

### Activities
- Break work into logical phases
- Define dependencies between phases
- Create ready-to-use prompts for each phase
- Establish exit criteria per phase
- Plan for phase splitting when complexity exceeds thresholds

### Output
`masterplan.md` - Detailed execution plan

### Masterplan Structure
```markdown
# [Project] Masterplan

## Vision & Goals
## Architecture Overview
## Complete Skill/Agent Index

## Phase 1: [Name]
### Goal
### Steps with Prompts
### Exit Criteria
### Dependencies

## Phase 2: [Name]
[repeat structure]

## Quality Guarantees
## Appendices
```

### Phase Splitting Criteria
Split a phase when:
- More than 700 lines of research content
- More than 5 reference files required
- More than 8-10 distinct sections
- Estimated execution exceeds conversation limits

### Key Principle
> "The masterplan should be detailed enough that each phase can be executed in a separate conversation without loss of context."

---

## Phase 5: Topic-Specific Research

### Purpose
Before creating each skill, conduct focused research on that specific topic.

### Activities
- Verify preliminary research against current documentation
- Deepen understanding of specific APIs/methods
- Gather additional examples
- Document version-specific behaviors
- Identify anti-patterns specific to this topic

### Output
`research-[topic].md` - Detailed research document per skill topic

### Research Document Structure
```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

## 1. Overview
## 2. Core Concepts
## 3. API Reference
## 4. Examples
## 5. Version Differences (v14 vs v15)
## 6. Anti-patterns
## 7. Best Practices
## 8. Sources

### For Skill Creation
- Key sections to include in SKILL.md
- Reference files needed
- Decision trees to create
```

### Key Principle
> "Never create a skill based on assumptions. Always verify against official documentation and source code."

---

## Phase 6: Skill Creation

### Purpose
Transform research into actionable, deterministic skills following platform conventions.

### Activities
- Create SKILL.md with quick reference and decision trees
- Create reference files (methods.md, examples.md, anti-patterns.md, etc.)
- Validate structure and line counts
- Create all language versions
- Package into distributable format

### Output
Complete skill packages (`.skill` files or folder structures)

### Skill Structure (Anthropic Convention)
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Main file (<500 lines)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter
│   ├── Quick Reference
│   ├── Decision Trees
│   ├── Essential Patterns
│   └── Links to references
└── references/
    ├── methods.md        # Complete API signatures
    ├── events.md         # Event listings
    ├── examples.md       # Working code examples
    └── anti-patterns.md  # What NOT to do
```

### SKILL.md Principles
1. **Lean**: Stay under 500 lines
2. **Deterministic**: "ALWAYS do X" not "consider doing X"
3. **Decision-oriented**: Include decision trees for common choices
4. **Reference-linked**: Detailed info in reference files

### Key Principle
> "A skill should enable another Claude instance to generate correct code on the first attempt, without needing clarification."

---

## Phase 7: Validation & Version Control

### Purpose
Ensure quality and preserve all work in version control.

### Activities
- Validate YAML frontmatter
- Check line counts
- Verify all language versions are complete
- Package skills
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to GitHub
- Verify repository state

### Output
- Validated skill packages
- Updated GitHub repository

### Commit Message Format
```
Phase [number]: [action] [subject]

Examples:
- Phase 4.3: Add erpnext-impl-controllers skill
- Phase 2.8.1: Add hooks event documentation
- Phase 1.2: Complete server scripts research
```

### Post-Phase Checklist
- [ ] All files validated
- [ ] SKILL.md in folder root (Anthropic convention)
- [ ] Files in correct repository location
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Verify files in repository
- [ ] **UPDATE ROADMAP.md** ← CRITICAL!
  - [ ] Add changelog entry with date and description
  - [ ] Update status table (percentages, checkmarks)
  - [ ] Update "Next Steps" section

### Key Principle
> "Every completed phase must be pushed to version control. Work that isn't committed doesn't exist."

> "ROADMAP.md is the single source of truth for project status. If it's not updated, the next session won't know where we left off."

### Document Naming Conventions
| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Research | `research-[topic].md` | `research-client-scripts.md` |
| Skill | `erpnext-syntax-[topic]-[lang].skill` | `erpnext-syntax-hooks-NL.skill` |
| Amendment | `masterplan-aanpassing-fase-[x].md` | `masterplan-aanpassing-fase-2_6.md` |

---

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Research Before Action
Never start creating skills without thorough research. Assumptions lead to incorrect or incomplete skills.

### 2. One-Shot Mindset
Plan thoroughly so each phase can be executed correctly the first time. No "we'll fix it later" mentality.

### 3. Deterministic Content
Skills must provide clear, unambiguous guidance. Avoid phrases like:
- ❌ "You might want to consider..."
- ❌ "It's often good practice to..."
- ✅ "ALWAYS use X when Y"
- ✅ "NEVER do X because Y"

### 4. Version Explicitness
Always document which versions of the target technology are supported and note any differences.

### 5. Verification Loop
```
Research → Verify → Document → Verify → Create → Validate
```

### 6. Version Control Discipline
Commit and push after every completed phase. This ensures:
- Work is never lost
- Progress is trackable
- Collaboration is possible
- Rollback is available

---

## Project Status Tracking

### The Problem: Duplicate Tracking

A common mistake is tracking project status in multiple places:
- Claude Project Instructions
- ROADMAP.md
- README.md
- Conversation context

This leads to:
- **Inconsistency**: Different sources show different status
- **Maintenance burden**: Must update multiple places
- **Confusion**: Which source is correct?

### The Solution: Single Source of Truth

**ROADMAP.md is the ONLY place for project status tracking.**

| What | Where | Update Frequency |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Current phase & progress | ROADMAP.md | After EVERY phase |
| Methodology & workflows | WAY_OF_WORK.md | When process changes |
| Technical lessons | LESSONS.md | When discoveries made |
| Open tasks | GitHub Issues | As needed |
| Project instructions | Claude Project | Only for HOW, never for WHERE |

### Why This Matters

Claude's filesystem resets between sessions. The only persistent state is GitHub. If ROADMAP.md isn't updated:
- Next session starts without knowing current progress
- Risk of duplicate work
- Lost context about what was completed

### Implementation Rules

1. **Never hardcode status in Claude Project Instructions**
   - Instructions should describe HOW to work, not WHERE we are
   - Reference ROADMAP.md for current status

2. **ROADMAP.md update is MANDATORY after each phase**
   - Add changelog entry with date
   - Update status percentages
   - Update "Next Steps" section

3. **Session start protocol**
   - Always fetch ROADMAP.md first
   - Check changelog for last completed work
   - Confirm current phase before proceeding

### Template: ROADMAP.md Structure

```markdown
# ROADMAP - [Project Name]

> **📍 This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for project status.**

> **Last update**: [date]
> **Current phase**: [phase]

## Quick Status
[Table with categories, completed, remaining, total]

## Next Steps
[Immediate priorities]

## Phase Overview
[Detailed phase breakdown with status]

## Changelog
[Reverse chronological log of completed work]
```

---

## Handling Complexity

### When to Split Phases
Monitor these thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Research lines | >700 | Split into sub-phases |
| Reference files | >5 | Consider splitting |
| Sections | >8-10 | Split by logical grouping |
| Conversation length | Near limit | Split remaining work |

### Phase Split Process
1. Identify logical division points
2. Create amendment document
3. Update masterplan
4. Ensure sub-phases are independent (no circular dependencies)
5. Document the split rationale

---

## Session Recovery Protocol

### Purpose
Handle interrupted sessions (crashes, disconnects) gracefully and resume work without duplication or loss.

### The Problem
Claude's filesystem resets between sessions. When a session is interrupted mid-phase:
- Some files may have been pushed to GitHub
- Others may be lost
- Context about progress is lost

### Recovery Procedure

When starting a session that might be a continuation of interrupted work:

#### Step 1: Scan GitHub State
```bash
# Check recent commits
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/[org]/[repo]/commits?per_page=5"

# Check specific directories for recent files
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/[org]/[repo]/contents/skills/source/[category]"
```

#### Step 2: Check ROADMAP.md
The changelog section in ROADMAP.md contains the most recent completed work:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/[org]/[repo]/contents/ROADMAP.md"
```

Look for:
- Last changelog entry date
- Last completed phase/step
- Files mentioned as created

#### Step 3: Identify Interruption Point
Compare:
- What ROADMAP says was completed
- What files actually exist in the repository
- What the user says they were working on

#### Step 4: Confirm Before Continuing
Always ask the user before resuming:
```
"I see that Phase X.Y was partially completed. The following files 
are already pushed:
- file1.md ✅
- file2.md ✅

The following appear to be missing:
- file3.md ❌

Should I continue from [specific step]?"
```

### Prevention: Push Early, Push Often
To minimize recovery complexity:
1. Push each file immediately after creation
2. Update ROADMAP.md changelog after each significant step
3. Use atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

### Key Principle
> "GitHub is the source of truth. Always scan repository state before assuming you need to start fresh."

## Tools & Resources

### Essential Tools
- **Web Search**: For current documentation verification
- **Project Knowledge Search**: For accessing project documents
- **File Creation/Editing**: For document creation
- **Bash Tools**: For validation scripts, line counts
- **GitHub API**: For version control operations

### Validation Scripts
- `quick_validate.py` - YAML frontmatter validation
- `package_skill.py` - Skill packaging
- `wc -l` - Line count verification

### Research Sources (Priority Order)
1. Official documentation (highest priority)
2. GitHub source code
3. Community resources (recent only, 2023+)

---

## Lessons Learned

### From the ERPNext Project

1. **Sandbox Limitations Matter**: We discovered that Frappe Server Scripts block all imports - this fundamental limitation affected all code generation guidance.

2. **Phase Splitting is Normal**: Complex topics like hooks.py and custom apps required splitting into multiple sub-phases. Plan for this.

3. **Memory Helps Continuity**: Using Claude's memory feature to store project context greatly improved consistency across conversations.

4. **English-Only Skills**: Skills are instructions FOR Claude, not for end users. Claude reads English and responds in ANY language. Creating bilingual skills doubles maintenance without functional benefit. See "Key Lesson: English-Only Skills" section below.

5. **GitHub Integration is Essential**: Pushing after each phase prevents work loss and enables collaboration.

6. **Single Source of Truth for Status**: Never track project status in multiple places. ROADMAP.md is the only place for status - Claude Project Instructions should describe HOW to work, not WHERE we are. Duplicate tracking leads to inconsistency and confusion.

## Template: Starting a New Skill Package Project

### Initial Prompt
```
I want to create a comprehensive skill package for [TECHNOLOGY] that will 
enable Claude instances to generate correct [TECHNOLOGY] code.

Let's start with deep research:
1. What are all the major mechanisms/APIs in [TECHNOLOGY]?
2. What are common pitfalls and anti-patterns?
3. What version differences exist?

Document your findings - this will become our preliminary research.
```

### After Research
```
Based on our research, let's define requirements:
1. What skills do we need? (syntax, implementation, error handling, agents?)
2. What languages should we support?
3. What quality guarantees do we want to provide?

Then create a detailed masterplan with phases and prompts.
```

### For Each Phase
```
Execute Phase [X.Y]: [Name]

Follow the masterplan prompt. After completion:
1. Validate all outputs
2. Commit: "Phase [X.Y]: [description]"
3. Push to GitHub
4. Verify repository state
```

---

## Conclusion

This methodology transforms the challenge of creating comprehensive AI skill packages into a manageable, systematic process. By emphasizing research, planning, and version control, it ensures that the resulting skills are:

- **Accurate**: Based on verified information
- **Deterministic**: Providing clear guidance
- **Complete**: Covering all relevant aspects
- **Maintainable**: Organized and version-controlled

The key insight is that **skills are only as good as the research behind them**. Invest time in understanding the technology deeply before attempting to codify that knowledge into skills.

*This methodology was developed during the ERPNext/Frappe Skills Package project by the OpenAEC Foundation, January 2025.*

---

## Key Lesson: English-Only Skills

**Original assumption**: Create bilingual (NL + EN) skills for accessibility.

**Discovery**: Anthropic's own skills are ALL English-only. Analysis revealed:
- Skill instructions are for Claude, not end users
- Claude can read English instructions and respond in ANY language
- Bilingual skills double maintenance without functional benefit
- Anthropic's `package_skill.py` expects simple folder structure

**Recommendation**: Always create English-only skills unless you have a very specific reason to deviate.

---

## Anthropic Tooling Compatibility

Before choosing your directory structure, **test with Anthropic's official tooling**:

```bash
# Validate skill structure
python quick_validate.py path/to/skill-folder

# Package skill
python package_skill.py path/to/skill-folder output/
```

**Critical requirement**: `SKILL.md` must be DIRECTLY in the skill folder root, not in subfolders.

```
✅ CORRECT:
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          ← Direct in root
└── references/

❌ WRONG:
skill-name/
├── EN/
│   └── SKILL.md      ← In subfolder - will FAIL
└── NL/
    └── SKILL.md
```

---

*Updated: January 2026 - Added Session Recovery Protocol, Project Status Tracking principles, English-only clarifications, v16 compatibility*
